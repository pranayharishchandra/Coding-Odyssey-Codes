    * Why to use "PRIORITY QUEUE" and not "QUEUE": https://youtu.be/3dINsjyfooY?list=PLgUwDviBIf0oE3gA41TKO2H5bHpPd7fzn&t=174

    * answer: because we don't want to travel 2 different paths to find the shortest path 
    * to a node, so for finding paths optimally so we don't waste our traversals/explorations we use PQ
    * so we are "GREEDLY" finding the shortest path
